## v1.1.0
### Added
* Set Use to clear previous ACL tokens when called to avoid conflicts
* Caching, the way it should have been from the beginning.
* Ensuring we include the version during builds
* Adding more testing for commands
* `--detailed` flag to `list` with colored output
* `self update` command added to allow pulling in the latest version
### Changed
* Changed the naming of assets on releases to match more of what Go provides built-in
### Fixed
* Fixed bug where cache setting was not actually being checked
* Removed print statement in use that caused eval to fail
* Fixing an issue where running `use` could error out due to there not being any cached data
