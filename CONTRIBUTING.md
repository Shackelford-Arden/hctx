## Tooling

This project makes use of a couple tools:

* `changie`
  * Used for managing the generation of the Changelog.
* `task` - [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev)
  * Conceptually similar to how Makefiles are used in many projects

## Pull Requests

Nothing too crazy here:

* CI/tests are expected to pass. New tests are not always required, but are preferred and may be requested.
* Use `changie` to provide changelog items
